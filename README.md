# BeatDownloader
Download many custom Beat Saber songs at once with ease


# What is this?
This is a program coded in NodeJS that bulk downloads custom Beat Saber songs from various websites. 

# Why did you make this?
I didn't see any good bulk downloader, and personally I like to download a ton (thousands) of songs so when im playing, I just hit random and see what I get.

# What does this program allow me to do?
This program allows you to download however many songs you want by category (rating, latest, etc) or author. It also lets you select by which site you would like to download from.

# How can I get started?
Head over to the releases tab, or download the source and run it directly (if you're into that kind of thing). Each build will include releases for Windows, Mac and Linux.

This readme will be updated soon to give a more in-depth description about the program.
